## Basic Commands

Interacting with Salt means using one of the command-line tools. There are several commands, but for the moment we care only about the following four:
```
    /usr/bin/salt
    /usr/bin/salt-key
    /usr/bin/salt-run
    /usr/bin/salt-call
```
The one you will care the most about is the basic salt command.
